This repository contains some thoughts (usually additional geometric insight) for various machine learning algorithms.
                                                                             
### Regression                                                              
                                                                             
I was teaching myself some classical statistics and was a bit puzzled as to what was meant by "degrees of freedom" (dimension) or how the F distribution arose in F-tests and ANOVA. This writeup is a treatment of these topics with a geometrical flavor using norms, vector spaces, and projection operators rather than matrix manipulations.
