For now, this repository contains a writeup of some of my own understanding     of classical regression that I wanted to get out of my head and into writing.
                                                                             
### Regression                                                              
                                                                             
I was teaching myself some classical statistics and was a bit puzzled as to     what was meant by "degrees of freedom" (dimension) or how the F distribution     arose in F-tests and ANOVA. This writeup is a treatment of these topics wit    h a geometrical flavor using norms, vector spaces, and projection operators     rather than matrix manipulations.
